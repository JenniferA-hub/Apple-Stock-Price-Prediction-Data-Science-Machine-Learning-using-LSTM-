AIM:

To use Long Short Term Memory , Time-series regression and Machine Learning(Using Python) to create a Regression model that will predict Apple's Stock Price for the next 30 days

METHODOLOGY The data set was obtained from Tiingo ,with the use of requests from the site and an API key for access to the stock market data Python Programming was used as the coding language Jupyter Notebook was used for Exploratory Data Analysis, visualizations and Time-series Regression model training and validation RMSE (Root Mean Square Root) was used as a metric for measuring the accuracy of the trained model results

Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning steps:

Import all necessary libraries(pandas,numpy,matplotlib, sci-kit learn ,tensorflow, keras)
Data Exploratory
Data Cleaining(i.eremoving duplicates,isolating necessary columns ,and NaN)
Data Analysis
Splitting data into training and validation sets
Training the model
Obtaining predictive outcomes
Using the validation set and RMSE to check the training set accuracy
CONCLUSION :

1.The stock prices of Apple will decrease from $170 to $140 ,according the time-series regression model created

2.The Machine Learning model had a RMSE (9800) lower than the Normalised Root Mean Square(approc 20 500)

This conclusion means that the Times-series model is considered accurate,however a percentage score of approx 46.2% means the model needs to be refined, to obtain a lower and more accurate score for better predictive outputs
